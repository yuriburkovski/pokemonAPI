It's a REST API project in the Three-Tier Architecture pattern

The next stack of technologies was used:
- Spring Boot (such modules as: Web, Data, Security);
- automation build tool Maven;
- database H2;
- system of version control Git;

project was deployed in Heroku:  https://pokemon-academy-api.herokuapp.com/
To check how does it work, I'm suggest to use Swagger ( https://pokemon-academy-api.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html )
/* "admin" as login and "test" as password
are adding by default to the database */
